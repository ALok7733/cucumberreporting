Virtualization:
when we need to execute our Automation test cases only on windows it will be easy
we can write test cases and run on any windows operating system
when we need to execute the same code on different operating system then problem arises
For this we can install different operating system on our system using virtualization.
1>oracle virtual machine
2>Hypervisor

Difficulties while execution on VM:
we need to install the set up on All the operating system
time and money waste
Memory wastage

Container:
we don't have multiple os
here we only have binaries and supporting files
so Memory wastage is very less
that's why it is very light weight
Every container is independent
Containers do not have their own operating system
so it is a type of virtual machine where we do not have to worry while set up
what ever disadvantages to virtual machine, we can achieve  here
self sustain.

Configurarion:
Host server->
