steps to cherrypick:

step-1:
first clone the latest project from repo
step-2:
we need to go to particular commit which is not merged with master branch
then select the Download patch option from 3dots
then copy the cherrypick command
git fetch ssh://link refs/changes/15/328415/1 && git cherry-pick FETCH_HEAD

step-3:
go to location where we have our latest clone project
open the cmd in this location
paste the checrrypick command
git fetch ssh://link refs/changes/15/328415/1 && git cherry-pick FETCH_HEAD

Here we will see the previous changes what we already commited in our local branch
step-4:
Do what update we needed for the branch
DO the file modification as per requirement

step-5:
git status
open git gui
